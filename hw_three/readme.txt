GUI Assignment:  HW3 - Multiplication table
  Description: This page allows the user to enter inputs for a multiplication table.
    After reading the inputs, they are validated and errors are shown when necessary.
    If validation is successful, then the table is shown.

Note: The border around the table header is a little ugly, but I couldn't find something
that was both distinct enough to seperate the headers, and also not ugly.
