                    I am a senior studying computer science at UMass Lowell. I am a commuter student
                    from Westford, MA. Once I graduate in 2022, I hope to work a software development
                    job somewhere in New England, probably in Massachusetts or Vermont.

                <div class="col-8">
                        Most of my experience in CS is in the area of frontend development. My first exposure to this
                    was prior to college, when I took free courses on web development on freecodecamp's website. My first
                    experience working in frontend development was when I started working for a professor on campus. Here I learned
                    about React, which is a javascript framework that allows developers to easily integrate html
                    and javascript to create components which can they be reused.
                        After working there for about a year, I go a co-op at Kronos (now Ultimate Kronos Group). There, 
                    I learned about Angular and AngularJS. AngularJS is the first version of Angular, which differs greatly
                    from Angular 2 and onward. Angular is similar to React in that it allows for component creation, but it
                    is generally regarded as both a more powerful and complicated framework.

                <div class="col-8">
                    When I am not working or studying, some of my favorite hobbies are watching UFC
                    and playing video games with my friends. My current favorite games are Destiny 2 
                    and Monster Hunter World.I have also been spending some of my spare time to learn 
                    about the stock market, where I am applying my learning to a personal project written
                    in Angular with Typescript.
